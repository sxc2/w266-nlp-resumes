      "vancomycin resistance of staphylococcus aureus is causing an increasing difficulty in treating this superbug. however, it is still not clearly understood how staph regulates this resistance mechanism genetically. i created knockout mutants in vancomycin resistant staph strains and using modern techniques, researched on how a particular regulator gene controls the establishment of vancomycin resistance. this project gave us a clear idea about how a gene, previously discovered by us, contributes in the drug resistance and stress response regulation of staph. • there were some hurdles in studying the role of regulator genes in depth including difficulty in expressing one of the staph proteins. i designed a project and led a team of undergraduates, which resulted in successful expression of the protein. this allowed us to extend our study. • i planned a project and designed experiments to study the epidemiology of staph isolates from infected patients. this project was done in collaboration with the infectious disease department of the forrest general hospital, a major referral hospital in south mississippi, and the mississippi state department of health.\n",

      "the accurate electron density distribution and magnetic properties of two metal–organic polymeric magnets, the quasi-one-dimensional (1d) cu(pyz)(no3)2 and the quasi-two-dimensional (2d) [cu(pyz)2(no3)]no3·h2o, have been investigated by high-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations on the whole periodic systems and on selected fragments. topological analyses, based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules, enabled the characterization of possible magnetic exchange pathways and the establishment of relationships between the electron (charge and spin) densities and the exchange-coupling constants. in both compounds, the experimentally observed antiferromagnetic coupling can be quantitatively explained by the cu–cu superexchange pathway mediated by the pyrazine bridging ligands, via a σ-type interaction. from topological analyses of experimental charge-density data, we show for the first time that the pyrazine tilt angle does not play a role in determining the strength of the magnetic interaction. taken in combination with molecular orbital analysis and spin density calculations, we find a synergistic relationship between spin delocalization and spin polarization mechanisms and that both determine the bulk magnetic behavior of these cu(ii)-pyz coordination polymers.\n",

      "we present the results of muon-spin relaxation measurements of spin excitations in the one-dimensional quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet cu(pyz)(no3)2. using density-functional theory we propose muon sites and assess the degree of perturbation the muon probe causes on the system. we identify a site involving the muon forming a hydroxyl-type bond with an oxygen on the nitrate group that is sensitive to the characteristic spin dynamics of the system. our measurements of the spin dynamics show that in the temperature range tn&lt;t&lt;j (between the ordering temperature tn and the exchange energy scale j) the field-dependent muon spin relaxation is characteristic of diffusive transport of spin excitations over a wide range of applied fields. we also identify a possible crossover at higher applied fields in the muon probe's response to the fluctuation spectrum, to a regime where the muon detects early-time transport with a ballistic character. this behavior is contrasted with that found for t&gt;j and that in the related two-dimensional system cu(pyz)2(clo4)2.\n",

      "vancomycin resistance of staphylococcus aureus is causing an increasing difficulty in treating this superbug. however, it is still not clearly understood how staph regulates this resistance mechanism genetically. i created knockout mutants in vancomycin resistant staph strains and using modern techniques, researched on how a particular regulator gene controls the establishment of vancomycin resistance. this project gave us a clear idea about how a gene, previously discovered by us, contributes in the drug resistance and stress response regulation of staph. • there were some hurdles in studying the role of regulator genes in depth including difficulty in expressing one of the staph proteins. i designed a project and led a team of undergraduates, which resulted in successful expression of the protein. this allowed us to extend our study. • i planned a project and designed experiments to study the epidemiology of staph isolates from infected patients. this project was done in collaboration with the infectious disease department of the forrest general hospital, a major referral hospital in south mississippi, and the mississippi state department of health.\n",

      "doctoral dissertation (will be available after jan 2017) abstract: in gwas, variable selection has been used for prioritizing candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp). the current paradigm of variable selection, pursuing a sparse solution, is unsuitable to apply for the analysis of complex trait, as many genetic factors are weakly associated with the trait. identifying many weak signals requires the accuracy in estimation, however existing variable selection methods did not show satisfactory results on sequencing data: lasso showed too many false positives, and bayesian lasso by gibbs samplers did not converge correctly.     my proposals to improve bayesian lasso include two aspects: stochastic approximation, variational bayes increases computational efficiency and a shrinkage prior, dirichlet-laplace separates small effects from nulls more accurately. in the analysis of simulated and real sequencing data, the proposed methods yields meaningful improvements. the proposed method can be used for another purpose to improve a kernel-based snp-set test. the performance of a kernel-based snp-set test is highly dependent on a choice of snp-set, however no optimal rule is available. refining a testing region around the snps selected by our proposal led to more findings on genetic associations of complex traits.\n",
